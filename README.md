## Description

This project demonstrates microservices architecture based application.

Main application features:

- users can create, list, update and delete tasks
- services use different databases.

Application consists of three services:

- User service - Create, update, delete, and show all users
- Tasks service - Create, update, and delete taks. This service can show all tasks of a user as well

Live servers:

- User interface (React app) - <https://to-do-app-904.herokuapp.com/>
- User service - <https://user-microservices.herokuapp.com/api/v1/status>
- Tasks service - <https://tasks-microservice-904.herokuapp.com/api/v1/tasks/1>
